    <p> I'm not studios person like other but I always put in my mind that in studying this is not a competition. </p>
    <p>It's  hard to take the first step for study but once you take it, you will end up learning many things.</p>
    <p> Nobody can go back and start a new beginning,but anyone can start today and make a new ending.</p>
